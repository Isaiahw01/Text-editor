## Description

This application was specifically developed to showcase and enhance skills in progressive web application development. Its main goal was to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the React JavaScript library. The application focuses on four key areas:
* 		Configuration: Setting up the webpack.config.js file with essential workbox plugins for service worker and manifest files, along with CSS and babel loader for compatibility with older code.
* 		Offline functionality: Implementing asset caching in the src-sw.js file to enable the application to work offline.
* 		Database integration: Configuring the database to facilitate data management, including addition, updating, and retrieval from the IndexedDB.
* 		User-friendly installation: Adding event handlers to the install button for easy installation on personal application stacks and offline usage.
